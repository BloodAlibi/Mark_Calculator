# Mark Calculator
**Mark Calculator is a Python tool to convert a specific mark into its equivalent with another mark base.** For example, 15/20 into 75/100.

## How to use
Before going into how to use it, find below the words used in this document :
- The Mark, represents your grade in the shortest terms. For example, if you had 17/20 or 56/100, it basically only represents the 17 and 56.
- The Mark Base, represents the base your grade has. It usually represents the best you can possibly have. For example, if you had 15/20 or 90/100, it represents the 20 and the 100.

The program can be used very easily, with only three inputs. First, it will ask for the Mark (WITHOUT THE MARK BASE) (see above for its meaning). It will then ask for your Mark Base (again, see above for the meaning). And at the end, it will ask for your new Mark Base. For example, if you wanted to convert 17/20 into ?/100, it would be the 100.

Find below an example of use :

After using it once, the program will automatically ask for a new input, without deleting the past outputs.
